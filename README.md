## **The Problem Statement**
HELP International have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. So, CEO has to make decision to choose the countries that are in the direst need of aid. Hence, your Job as a Data scientist is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.</br>
The model alongwith the preprocessing steps have been implemented in C++.
So using the SOM algorithm we have found the top-3 countries which require the most help from NGO.
